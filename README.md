# Iceberg Summit Workshop: Getting Started with Iceberg ðŸš€

Welcome! Let's dive into Apache Iceberg together in this interactive, hands-on workshop. Whether you're brand-new or already familiar with Iceberg, you'll walk away with practical skills and resources to confidently integrate Iceberg into your data workflows.

We'll explore Iceberg fundamentals, core concepts, and real-world table operations using Python-based tools like PyIceberg and DuckDB. Together, we'll follow data through the entire lifecycleâ€”from ingestion and transformation to multi-engine querying.

This first session is a warm-up focused on clear, easy-to-follow examples of basic table operations with PyIceberg to introduce you to the essentials of Iceberg.
